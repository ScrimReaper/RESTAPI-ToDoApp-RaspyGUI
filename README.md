# ToDoApp Project

## Overview

The **ToDoApp** is a project designed to challenge my skills by diving into tools and technologies I had little to no experience with. Sure, it’s a task manager app on the surface, but honestly, it was never really about the app. The real fun (and sweat) was in developing the API and backend systems. That’s where I had the most fun, which might explain why the frontend looks like every backend developer’s "I swear it works!" project — functional, but let’s just say design wasn’t the priority here. Still, it’s a task manager that works on mobile devices and even a Raspberry Pi-based display, which is pretty cool.

## Key Features

- **Task Synchronization**: Used a REST API to manage and sync tasks between the app and a Raspberry Pi display.
- **Raspberry Pi Integration**: Set up a standalone display powered by the Raspberry Pi to show tasks dynamically and in real time.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built reusable components for better scalability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: REST API (C++)
- **Development Tools**: WebStorm, Expo, CLion, VSCodium
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 with an LCD touchscreen

## What I Learned

### Frontend Development

1. **React Native**: Learned state management and how to create modular, reusable components.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: Improved at building logic that’s self-contained and reusable (and doesn’t make me want to scream when debugging).

### Backend Development

1. **REST API Design**: Figured out how to structure APIs for smooth communication between frontend and backend.
2. **JavaScript for API Calls**: Got comfortable with making API calls, handling asynchronous operations, and managing RESTful data exchanges.
3. **Data Synchronization**: Designed methods to keep tasks consistent across platforms without losing my sanity.
4. **Programming Skills**: Sharpened my TypeScript and JavaScript skills and  ventured into C++ for the API, which was pretty easy to learn.

### Raspberry Pi Integration

1. **Hardware Interaction**: Hooked up a Raspberry Pi touchscreen display to act as a dynamic task viewer.
2. **Cross-Device Communication**: Used a REST API to keep the hardware and software in sync without any major explosions.

### General Skills

1. **Project Management**: Learned to (somewhat) plan, execute, and manage a full-stack project without flying by the seat of my pants.
2. **Version Control**: Got better at using GitHub for tracking progress and keeping things organized.
3. **Problem-Solving**: Tackled challenges like task synchronization, responsive design, and making sure everything actually works together.

## Future Plans

- **Docker Deployment**: Dive into Docker to deploy the app, make it portable.
- **Enhanced Responsiveness**: Make the app look and feel great across all devices, no matter the screen size.
- **Dark Mode**: Add a dark theme because everyone loves dark mode.
- **Drag and Drop**: Add functionality to drag and drop tasks between lists.

## Acknowledgements

This project has been a wild ride and a huge milestone in my learning journey, taught me that I really need more structure in my chaos. Turns out coding without thinking it thru is not the best approach (who knew?). Let’s just say I restarted this project more times than I’d like to admit, but I think that was crucial for my
learning. Although C++ is probably the most unpopular choice for a quick REST API, I am so happy that i chose it, really changed my understanding for programming languages, compilers, etc. as a whole. It’s been frustrating, fun, and full of lessons that will definitely shape how I tackle future projects. To more plans and fewer facepalms next time!
